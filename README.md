# battle
An old naval battle game that I developed a long time ago, in high school.

For compiling and running it on modern systems (tested on Windows 7 64 bits) download Turbo C++ from CodePlex (https://turboc.codeplex.com/) and install it. Then launch it and:
- add code directory to Turbo C++ directories lists for the includes;
- change path in interfac.cpp:6 to "sprites" directory under your code directory;
- change path in interfac.cpp:13 to "bgi" directory under your Turbo C++ install directory;
- compile and run.
